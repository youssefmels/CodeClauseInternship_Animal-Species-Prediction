# CodeClauseInternship_Animal-Species-Prediction
This project is a part of my artificial intelligence internship at CodeClause. It is a model that predicts the type of animal in an image. The dataset consists of 5400 images and 90 classes. It was later split into training and validation (0.2 split).

I used VGG16 and employed fine-tuning to get the best results. I utilized dropout and L2 for regularization to reduce loss and prevent overfitting.

In the code, I visualized the accuracy and loss of the train and validation when freezing the weights and after unfreezing the weights.
I would like to thank CodeClause for giving me this opportunity to learn and work on this project.
